# LIO-2-PX4
ROS package/node for relaying lidar odometry from [LIO-SAM](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/LIO-SAM) to [PX4 Autopilot](https://px4.io/).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a proof of concept to show that interfacing LIDAR with PX4 is possible.
Typical flight controllers such as [Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/) or [Cube Orange](https://www.cubepilot.com/#/home)
only have accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers and barometers as onboard sensors.
When flying autonomously, these sensors are not enough to accurately estimate position, velocity and
attitude. 
LIO-2-PX4 uses PX4's external odometry pipeline to stream the fused LIDAR and IMU Odometry
messages
