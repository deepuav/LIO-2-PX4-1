# LIO-2-PX4
ROS package/node for relaying LIDAR odometry from [LIO-SAM](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/LIO-SAM) to [PX4 Autopilot](https://px4.io/).

### UPDATE 2023-11-09
After tests on actual drones, it appears that the coordinate frame adjustment is not needed for flight. The installation procedure below has been adjusted accordingly. The code has also been adjusted to avoid name space conflicts.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a proof of concept showing that interfacing [LIDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) with low-level flight flight control is possible. It uses PX4's
[external vision pipeline](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/external_position_estimation.html).
The ```lio_2_px4_node``` node subscribes to LIDAR intertial odometry (LIO, fused IMU and LIDAR data) from the LIO-SAM package on ROS topic ```odometry/imu```, downsamples it to 50Hz 
and publishes it on ```mavros/odometry/out```, where the [MAVROS Odometry plugin](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/mavros_extras/html/odom_8cpp_source.html)
in theory should handle all coordinate transformations. To get it to work, some adjustments to the coordinate frames are made as can be seen in the installation guide below.

Why LIO and not LIDAR? When PX4 fuses LIO, and LIO-SAM uses the flight controller's internal IMU:s, the IMU data is fused twice. Once by LIO-SAM and then by PX4. 
The reason is that the pure LIDAR odometry is too slow (5Hz on the development setup), while LIO is at 200Hz. PX4 requires 30-50Hz to fuse external odometry. This "double-fusion" has not 
been shown to be a problem in the testing (see <em>Examples</em> below or the accompanying [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmLYq_VWVp5K1mdh0_Pd0eSDejMme654/view?usp=sharing)). It seems to work but requires further testing.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
* [Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/) or other flight controller board running [PX4](https://px4.io/)
* LIDAR equipment (developed with [OUSTER](https://ouster.com/) LIDAR)
* [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)
* [ROS Noetic](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/mavros_installation.html)
* [MAVROS](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/mavros_installation.html)
* [LIO-SAM](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/LIO-SAM)
* [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo in your catkin workspace:
   ```sh
   cd <YOUR CATKIN WORKSPACE>/src
   ```
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jacobtorngr/LIO-2-PX4.git
   ```
2. Go back to your catkin workspace and build it:
   ```sh
   cd ~/<YOUR CATKIN WORKSPACE>
   ```
   ```sh
   catkin build
   ```
3. Source:
   ```sh
   source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```
4. Open QGroundControl and set parameters (optional but recommended):
   ```EKF2_EV_MASK```
   to **vision position fusion** and **vision yaw fusion** (```EKF2_AID_MASK``` in PX4 v1.13 and earlier).
   
5. Reboot the flight controller.

### Run the package
  Simply run the Python script:
   ```sh
   rosrun lio_2_px4 lio_2_px4.py
   ```

## Tuning
The main tuning parameters are
```EKF2_EV_POS_<X,Y,Z>```
denoting the offset between the PX4 body frame and external odometry frame of reference, and
```EKF2_EV_DELAY```
setting the time delay between the external odometry relative to the internal IMU:s. Further
instructions on how to tune can be found in the [PX4 EV and MoCap guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/external_position_estimation.html).
